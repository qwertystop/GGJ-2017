To build the game from source: Open the GGJ-2017-Blind-Bounce.project.gmx file in GameMaker,
then use GameMaker to build an executable of it in whatever platform you like (assuming you have the relevant GameMaker license).
In the GameMaker: Studio (free version) v1.4.1763 r41504 for Windows, that's:
1: Select build target in the "Target" drop-down near the top of the screen.
2: File -> Create Application
3: Further build target selection in the "save as type" drop-down (definitely there for Windows, don't know what other targets might have that)
4: Save. Wait for it to be done.
