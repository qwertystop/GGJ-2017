Runs in Windows 10 Home edition on an x64 processor.
May or may not work on other Windows editions;
I don't know how much compatibility GameMaker builds into its executables.
It certainly didn't let me chooose a Windows version or a processor architecture to run on,
but that might just mean it automatically selects the locally-running ones.
