Game can be built from the GameMaker source in ./src,
or run directly if on Windows from the executable in ./releases.

Description:
Bounce a ball around a dark area, working only by the visualization of the sound it makes on the floor and walls.
The faster it moves, the louder it is (hitting walls is constant volume, clarity over realism here).
There is a target somewhere in the room. If you get close enough for it to hear you, it lights up.
Touch it to win. The less times you hit the walls, the better.

Controls:
Arrow keys to accelerate in a direction.
Hold Shift to slow down.
Hold Ctrl while pressing arrow keys to accelerate more slowly.
